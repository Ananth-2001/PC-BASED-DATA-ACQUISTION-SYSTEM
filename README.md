# PC-BASED-DATA-ACQUISTION-SYSTEM
There is a demand for an integrated system that efficiently collects and displays real-time temperature and time data for monitoring purposes.  To address this need, I developed a PC-based data acquisition system that combines an RTC for precise timekeeping, an A2D converter  for temperature measurement with LM35 and appropriate protocols.
